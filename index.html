                <p>According to a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article written by Jennifer Mann in 2012, EMASS 
                    signed a contract in July 2000 with the St. Louis Circuit Court to become a 
                    provider of post-conviction supervision for misdemeanor defendants.

                    Although this contract
                    explicitly included an option to extend the contract length after the initial three-year
                    period, it was extended informally by virtue of the courts not taking action on this option.
                    It also wasn't reviewed even as EMASS also began offering services other than those outlined
                    in the initial contract (i.e. pre-trial supervision services).

                        Missouri's Department of Corrections brought pre-trial supervision programs to an end. 
                        In response to this, some jurisdictions in Missouri just established their own programs
                        but the St. Louis Circuit Court decided to partner with EMASS to provide supervision.
                        As a result, EMASS filled this gap between an initial charge and a defendant's trial
                        for St. Louis County.

                    <h2>2019: Ending Fee-Based Re-incarceration</h2>
                    <p>
                        On January 10th, 2019, a joint letter was sent to the 22nd Judicial Circuit Court in St. Louis by local
                        criminal justice organizations, addressing the court's pre-trial practices. In this letter, 
                        these local organizations called out the court for allowing EMASS to unconstitutionally 
                        collect monthly fees for pre-trial GPS monitoring ankle bracelets and other services 
                        from poor residents in the St. Louis area. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden_2019" hidden>
                        Representatives from <a href="http://www.archcitydefenders.org/2019/01/10/2288/">ArchCity Defenders</a>, 
                        <a href="https://bailproject.org/">The Bail Project</a> the St. Louis Public Defender's Office, 
                        the Mound Bar Association, <a href="https://www.aclu-mo.org/">the ACLU of Missouri</a>, and the Roderick & Solange MacArthur Justice Center 
                        all signed the letter. Discussing the release of those who are ordered by the court to
                        undergo some sort of court-ordered supervision, the letter says the following: 
                    </p>
                    <blockquote id="quote_2019" hidden>
                        "However, this release comes at a cost, as individuals have to pay
                        significant fees to this private company in order to remain free, and risk re-incarceration if they
                        find themselves unable to pay. As a result, these presumptively innocent individuals are
                        essentially shackled, often unconstitutionally, by the cost and burdens of private supervision, and
                        their inability to afford such costs has resulted in re-incarceration. Those who benefit from the
                        Circuit’s current practices appear to be private companies, not the St. Louis public.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="hidden_2019" hidden>
                        According to this statement, the court does not make sure that individuals who are released 
                        to court-ordered supervision through EMASS services have the ability to pay
                        for fees attached to this supervision. This spells bad news for indigent or particularly poor
                        residents whose cases are assigned to EMASS even though the contract between EMASS and the 
                        court says such cases should be taken care of at no cost. Rebecca Rivas of the St. Louis American
                        writes about the joint letter's release and lets us know that there have actually been no cases where 
                        poor residents passed on to EMASS haven't had to pay).

                    <h2>1969: Electronic Monitoring Pioneers</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Robert Gable and his twin brother Ralph came up with the first electronic monitoring system 
                        many decades ago. Formally, the invention was documented as a "behavior supervision system with wrist carried transceiver".
                        Such an invention, officially created by Ralph and colleague William Hurd, was meant 
                        to help at-risk youth using positive reinforcement techniques. Upon its creation,
                        there was no guarantee that such a device would actually serve its intended purpose.
                        Today, the use of wearables in the criminal justice system has gone away from the original vision the Gable brothers had; instead of a focus 
                        on rehabilitation, wearables (GPS monitors in ankle bracelets) are now an efficient punishment
                        strategy that largely benefits the private companies that produce such technology.

                    <p>
                        In 1977, New Mexico district court Judge Jack Love was intrigued by a Spider-Man 
                        cartoon that featured a similar type of monitor. Spurred on by a major prison 
                        crowding problem that was plaguing the United States as a whole, and hitting 
                        Albuquerque particularly hard, at that time, Judge Love was convinced that remote 
                        monitoring was a viable solution. By the early 1980s he had partnered up with 
                        ex-computer salesman Michael Goss to create the GOSSLink electronic monitor 
                        bracelet and he had begun to use the device to monitor a small number of probation 
                        violators. EM took off from there.

                    <h2>1980s: The First-Generation Expansion</h2>
                    <p>
                        By the mid-1980s, EM had expanded to around twenty jurisdictions across thirteen 
                        states, though still, fewer than a hundred devices were active at any given time 
                        in 1986. Companies tended to have regional control over EM manufacture and sales, 
                        and many quickly sprung up. It is important to realize that by this time, 
                        neo-conservative ideologies had become the mainstream line of thought regarding criminal 
                        justice; there was no talk of the rehabilitation that the Gable brothers had envisioned. 
                        Instead, these “first-generation” radio frequency devices just used one-way communication 
                        to tell monitoring agents whether the offender was within a small radius of their home 
                        telephone when they were expected to be.

                        Two big trends emerged with EM in the 1990s: first, “second-generation” devices, 
                        including GPS monitors that enabled 24/7 observation, were introduced. Second, 
                        the use of EM technology exploded -- to the point where over seventeen thousand 
                        devices were in daily use by 1994. These two trends were certainly related, but 
                        neither was singlehandedly responsible for the other; GPS did not develop a strong 
                        foothold in the market until the early 2000s.
